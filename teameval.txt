               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Honam Bang

 
B: Myron Liu

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings                      20              20	  	  	 
coding 	  	  	      20              20
writeup 	  	      10              10
planning (alone) 	       8               8  	  	 
total (including meetings)    68              68	  	  	 


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?
    Myron : coding communication among processes
    Honam : debugging and coding MPI_Reduce to calculate correctness
(b) Did you complete the assignment? Yes
(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
Our collaboration worked well for this time. We will keep working in the same way.
(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
Don't underestimate multi-processing power, there are many factors we should consider when we do programming (cache/communication cost/computation)

(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
We would try to discuss a lot more.
(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
None
